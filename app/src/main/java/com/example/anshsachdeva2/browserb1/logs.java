>>  By default, a WebView provides no browser-like widgets, does not enable JavaScript and web page
    errors are ignored.
>>  If your goal is only to display some HTML as a part of your UI, this is probably fine;
    the user won't need to interact with the web page beyond reading it(and the web
    page won't need to interact with the user).
>>  If you actually want a full-blown web browser, then:
        - you can invoke the Browser application with a URL Intent
        - you can make changes in the default behavior of webview

>>  Invoking browser via intent:
        Uri uri = Uri.parse("https://www.example.com");
        Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, uri);
        startActivity(intent);
    (todo : passing data/ images/files to view  in browser via intents)

>>  Customizing the webview :A WebView has several customization points where you can add your own
    behavior. These are:
    - Setting a WebChromeClient subclass
        This class is called when something that might impact a browser UI happens, for instance,
        progress updates and JavaScript alerts are sent here (see Debugging Tasks).
    - Setting a WebViewClient subclass
        It will be called when things happen that impact the rendering of the content, eg, errors or
        form submissions. You can also intercept URL loading here (via shouldOverrideUrlLoading()).
    - Modifying the WebSettings, such as enabling JavaScript with setJavaScriptEnabled().
    - Injecting Java objects into the WebView using the addJavascriptInterface(Object, String):
        This method allows you to inject Java objects into a page's JavaScript context, so that they
        can be accessed by JavaScript in the page.
